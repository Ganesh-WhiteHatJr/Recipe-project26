Tomato pasta

I like it because:- 
-> Pasta is also relatively easy to mass produce and transport around the world, making it a popular product with food companies as well. 
-> It's because it is cheap, versatile and convenient. You can create lots of different dishes with it.
-> It tastes good and it's filling.
-> There are a thousand and one pasta recipes, it goes with meat and fish, it works wonders with any number of sauces, it can be sautéed or baked, it can be eaten warm or as a cold salad.
-> It’s even delicious simply boiled and drizzled with extra-virgin olive oil and sprinkled with salt.
-> pirals (fusilli), cylindrical (macaroni, penne), long and thin (spaghetti, noodles), with a filling (ravioli), square (for lasagne).
